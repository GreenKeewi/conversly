Conversly — One Page Futuristic Voice Agent Website
🏷️ Project Name

Conversly — The Future of Voice Agents

🧩 Description

A minimal, futuristic landing page that introduces Conversly — a company that builds custom AI voice agents for businesses. The website should use smooth animations, 3D-like depth effects, and reactive lighting inspired by ReactBits.dev
.

This is a single-page site with dynamic, visually immersive sections. The design should instantly feel premium and ahead of its time — think Apple Vision Pro meets OpenAI aesthetics.
